Every great fiction (hyperstition is first and foremost a fiction) is a refrain, that is, a process by which cosmic forces are “rendered visible,” to use Klee’s phrase. A great work of fiction is an instrument for gathering specific forces within a milieu or territory and connecting them to the Cosmos that undergirds all things. Every fiction, in other words, is magical. In its cosmic function, every fiction brings forth a world."</p>
