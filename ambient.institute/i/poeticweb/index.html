        <blockquote>People believe there’s an essence to the computer, that there’s something true and real and a correct way to do things. But—there is no right way. We get to choose how to aim the technology we build. At least for now, because increasingly, technology feels like something that happens to you instead of something you use. We need to figure out how to stop that, for all of our sakes, before we’re locked in, on rails, and headed toward who knows what.

          One of the reasons that I’m so fascinated by screens is because their story is our story. First there was darkness, and then there was light. And then we figured out how to make that light dance. Both stories are about transformations, about change. Screens have flux, and so do we. &mdash; <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2013/what-screens-want/" target="_blank">Frank Chimero, What Screens Want</a></blockquote>

      <blockquote><strong>The web is what we make it.</strong> ...I believe the common prevailing metaphor—the internet as cloud—is problematic. The internet is not one all-encompassing, mysterious, and untouchable thing. (In early patent drawings depicting the internet, it appears as related shapes: a blob, brain, or explosion.) These metaphors obfuscate the reality that the internet is made up of individual nodes: individual computers talking to other individual computers.<br>

We want to share an abundance of links and rabbitholes that can help you. Don't be pressured to zoom through each exercise — feel free to continue dwelling on any work that has touched you most.</p>

        <p>This is targeted towards non-developers. If you are experienced with HTML/CSS/JS, it will be more interesting conceptually rather than technically.<br>
          <br>You will not be learning best practices. I want to think about poetry that is plundered and part of all that had come before it. This is applied to websites. We will be ripping things apart, I will be directing you to Google (because the most crucial learning is "how to think" and "how to write queries and prompts that get me to where I want to be quickly" more than anything else)... this is focused on expression, first and foremost.
          <br><br>
          The goal is to start creating. To think conceptually. To realize that you don't need to 'learn everything' to begin making websites, and that you can learn as you go.

      <h1>Why a poetic web?</h1>

      <p>Almost every website you browse today is maintained by large corporations, seeking to centralize our behavior. They are privately-controlled spaces that act as public ones. Go Google "Create a website" and a million 'site builders' promise you e-commerce solutions, ways to drive traffic, launch your business, build your brand or portfolio, showcase your art... Maybe you even want to do one of these things. We connect to websites but often feel disconected. Notice how many of these relate to attention, a performance, a gathering? (That's not the only takeaway, but a big one.)

        <br><br>

        What is the web today? What can the web be? What can a website be?
      </p>


      <p>The web is only the way it is because people have built it to be this way. It is seemingly strange that today, we seemingly have more tools than ever &mdash; but it seems a 'rarer' act to go out and publish something... but this shouldn't be a surprise. Information is obscured and gated, places where we can express ourselves and connect are often monetized. This is why it is worth moving towards a more handmade web&mdash;one that we've shaped ourselves. After all, the web is only the way it is because people have built it to be this way.</p>

      <p>Once you resist the current standard of what a 'website' in the 'web' looks like today, it is far easier to imagine what a website could be. </p>

      <img src="fun/comp.png">

      <p>A website after all, is fundamentally a vessel. It doesn't even have to serve 'content'. It doesn't have to be shared out to the whole world; it can be a link that only your friends have, or you can keep it all to yourself. It can have pictures and text and other links across multiple pages and even custom interactions, or it can just be a Google Doc. You can gather at a website from anywhere in the world in a single click, and begin sharing different entrypoints to your website by sharing the URL. You can have multiple websites for specific purposes, it doesn't have to host everything. Publishing' your website doesn't have to mean that it's finished; you are free to make an edit and have it appear instantaneously a second later. Or you can never touch it again and let it die. You can remove anything at once. You design the environment. <br>
        <br>A website is essentially a world you design. What will yours be?
      </p>


      <p>A <strong>poetic web</strong> is one that I imagine to be about creativity, expression, and the handmade. A lot of these thoughts resist the current state of the web: incredibly centralized, capital-driven, attention-seeking—far from what we associate with art. </p>

      <br>

        <h3>Making a Poetic Web</h3>
        <p>I want to think about your existing relationship with the internet and your thoughts about websites. What can a website be, and what doesn't it have to be?
          <br>
          <br>Let go of your existing notions of what the modern web looks like; return to more natural influences, for instance. A website can be anything. Compare it to something abstract, an animal, or another container with specific affordances. Think of qualities that you want in your website. Think of it as a piece of art, like a painting or a poem.

      <h1>How to explore these exercises</h1>


      <h3>First, we imagine.</h3>
      <p>Take a look at the first two exercise prompts and 'remix' them on Glitch. Preview the code and begin by modifying one thing at a time. Try to understand what each thing changes.</p>

      <p><strong>Choose an exercise that you are most interested on building on.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Settle on a concept, or tweak one thing at a time until you want to lean into that modification as the centerpiece of your work.</strong></p>

      <p>If you add any other modifications, I suggest making a new page. Maybe each page builds on the code from the pages before it, or each page is a new tweak.</p>

      <p>Imitate, copy, understand. Take things slowly. <strong>Focus on what you imagine.</strong> This workshop is not about best practices or doing things 'right', it's about getting you to <em>do.</em> Break down your concept into technical questions, search for them, and you will create your piece.</p>

      <h3>And then, we must make.</h3>

      <p>The biggest constraint to making is what we can imagine. HTML, CSS, and Javascript are tools you employ to make what you desire. This is why we first focus on <strong>concept</strong>.</p>

      <p>Technology is a bridge; let it be a bridge and not a barrier.</p>

      <p>Do not worry about what is below the code and let go of your fears in making. Think of something and let your website slowly get there.</p>
      <hr>
      <hr>
      <div class="notes">
        <h3>Other challenges</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Pair up with someone else in the class. A stranger or a friend. Work on your website together.</li>
          <li>Force yourself to pick one of the concepts in the 'What can a website be?' list above and make it.</li>
          <li>Copy a website that is <em>not in one of the exercises below</em>, tweak one fundamental aspect of it.</li>
          <li>Turn something else you have made into a website.</li>
          <li>Use Exercise 1 or 2. Make at least 10 different versions of them, each tweaking one thing. Do this by adding additional pages to your Glitch project.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>


        <h3>How to use Glitch</h3>
        <p>Glitch is a collaborative code editor that we'll be using to remix and preview work. Click on each exercise's Glitch page to see a screen like below.</p>

        <center>
          <img src="fun/glitch.jpg">

        </center>
        <ul>
          <li><strong style="color:#FF50C3;">Remixing.</strong> We will remix the Glitch project so you can create your own copy of the file. You'll have your own project after a bit of a load — the URL you see is actually a live site!</li>
          <li><strong style="color:#15B25D;">Files.</strong> The left sidebar contains the files in your project. You can upload images to Glitch here and create new pages too. If you don't see it, it might be collapsed—find a ">>" icon to surface it.</li>
          <li><strong style="color:#FF783E;">Tools.</strong> You can revert edits and import/export your file here. I highly recommend downloading your project by hitting <strong>Tools > Import/Export > Download Project</strong> with the turtle; it gives you a .zip folder containing your entire project that you can now edit locally or later upload to Github. You can also sync your project to Github if you have one.</li>
          <li><strong style="color:#FAFF0D;">Preview.</strong> If you don't see a preview of your website, toggle it by hitting the 'Preview' button and opening a preview pane, or open it in a new window. This preview pane refreshes automatically and is super helpful for looking through code.</li>
          <li><strong style="color:#2E43FF;">Project URL.</strong> If you are editing other files in your project that aren't <code>index.html</code>, you will have to navigate to that file in the preview pane to see it. For instance, if you're editing 'images.html' just type that in to see it!</li>
          <li><strong>Make sure to download your project or create a Glitch account so you can save your work!</strong> If you've made your exercise without an account, the project page gets deleted in 5 days.</li>
        </ul>

      <h1>EXERCISE ONE:<br>A Moving Poem</h1>

      <p>In the workshop's most literal sense: let's try creating a moving poem. Are you familiar with concrete poetry? Interactive fiction? What can the nature of a website's interactivity provide to words? </p>

      <p>Let's investigate how the form of a poem might change and evolve on a website — that is, all its different possibilities.</p>

        <h3>Your Own Moving Poem</h3>
        <p>With basic HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery, we'll be manipulating a moving poem. The template is set up and we'll be manipulating values and learning as we go along.<br><br>

          Focus on changing one thing at a time and trying to understand what it's changing.<br><br>

          The magical thing about code is that we can change one thing and instantly see some sort of feedback. Coding a website is just like a dance in response to one another.

        <li>Change words.</li>
        <li>(Maybe turn these into phrases or actions.)</li>
        <li>Delete a word.</li>
        <li>Delete everything within the <code>&lt;style</code> and <code>&lt;/style</code> tags. What has happened to the page? Bring it back.</li>
        <li>Delete everything within the <code>&lt;script</code> and <code>&lt;/script</code> tags. What has happened to the page? Bring it back. Or don't. Maybe the words can dance in another way.</li>
        <li>Change the title of the page to your poem's working title. You can change the title within the <code>&lt;title></code> tag at about Line 5 of the file.</li>
        <li>Add your own words.<br>Copy a <code>&lt;span></code> and add your own text. Note that this tag is always paired with a closing <code>&lt;<strong>/</strong>span></code> tag.</li>
        <li>One <code>&lt;span></code> tag has <code>class="unsortable"</code> inside of it. Classes are a type of "selector" used to style webpages. The <code>&lt;style></code> tags at the top contain rules for how stuff on the page looks; classes are selected with the <code>.</code> preceding their name. The styling declarations are contained in the curly brackets. Here, their opacity is faded.</li>
        <li>W3Schools has <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/" target="_blank">this extensive CSS reference</a>. Add CSS properties you find interesting (and applicable) with the respective values you see are allowed after reading their page. Reload your page and see results.</li>
        <li>All HTML elements can be supplemented with attributes. For instance, it's not enough to write the <code>&lt;img></code> tag if we wanted to add an image — where is the image link going to be placed? Attributes provide additional information to the element, always added in the opening tag.</li>

        <li>What if you add a <code>title</code> attribute to one of the <code>&lt;span></code>? This would look like <code>&lt;span title="The wind rustles..."></code>. Hover over the element you added a title attribute to and reveal another layer of text. <a href="https://alt-text-as-poetry.net/" target="_blank">You might be interested in alt text as poetry.</a></li>
        <li>This poem uses jQuery UI to "sort" its words, a library that extends jQuery with pre-written functions for fancy interactions. <a href="https://jqueryui.com/draggable/" target="_blank">It has other functions built in that you can read about here.</a> What if you change <code>sortable</code> to <code>draggable</code>? Do you need to change anything to make it work? </li>

        <h4 id="codeinfo">More on the code</h4>
        <p>Below is further explanation about the code. You don't have to read it before starting the exercise.</p>

        <center><img src="fun/project.jpg"></center>

        <p>
          There are three languages primarily used here to make the site.<br><br>


          <strong>HTML</strong> consists of <em>elements</em> that structure the page (so the other languages are interspersed between HTML) and also labels content.
        </p>

        <center><img src="fun/htmlelement.png"></center>
        <p>We use <strong>tags</strong> enclosed in brackets &lt; > to write an HTML element. The ending tag has a slash / before its name, marking the end of a tag. We write the 'content' within these tags.<br>HTML elements can contain words like <code>&lt;bold>this&lt;/bold></code>, or they might contain other HTML elements to provide structure. In the code example above, <code>&lt;html></code> begins the document.</p>
        <center><img src="fun/attributes.png"></center>

        <p>You might notice that some HTML tags aren't as simple. HTML elements can contain <strong>attributes</strong>, where here <code>title="rain comes"</code>; the attribute 'title' with the value 'rain comes' gives some additional effects and properties to our HTML element.</p>
        <hr>

        <p><strong>CSS</strong> affects the 'styling' of the page, and begins within the HTML tags <code>&lt;style</code>. As it's a different language, the syntax looks a bit different: but you may notice that the names of HTML elements are referenced before curly brackets {} enclose rules about HTML's appearance.
        </p>

        <center><img src="fun/body.png"></center>

        <p>Here, the element 'body' is given a property 'text-align' with a value 'center'. We end each property with a semicolon ; so we can assign multiple properties to an element, evolving its appearance. Other properties you could try are 'color', 'font-size', or 'padding', for instance. Properties and the values they take aren't always intuitive, so you're encouraged to look things up. For instance, the property 'opacity' takes values from 0 to 1.</p>

        <hr>

        <p><strong>Javascript</strong> provides the movement of our exercise and is used for interactivity. We use external libraries, primarily jQuery and its accompanying jQuery UI that have prewritten functions to make our desired interactions easier to achieve. The HTML element <code>&lt;script></code> that takes in URLs is calling these external libraries. Note that this workshop doesn't focus on Javascript and in fact &mdash; normal Javascript without jQuery wouldn't look this way. The syntax with dollar signs $ is primarily associated with jQuery (but not exclusively). </p>

      <h1>EXERCISE THREE:<br>Rip it off</h1>

      <p>This prompt is far less directed. Think about your initial idea for a website&mdash;whether it was something grand, or now you just want to make a little personal site.<br><br>
        Build something from an idea you or someone else had. If it's a bit too much, try to scale it down. Take an existing template and tweak one small aspect of it &mdash;lean into that one modification.<br>If you wanted to build a world, start with a small room. Make a tour of your desk, for instance. Latch onto something you really like conceptually so that you have a finished output to share—whether you're ready to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18d4qbknqKAC631YSSE-cL6K0hOVHhDuIrVLD8zdGJAg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">put it on the class sheet</a> right during this meeting or you'll be working on it more throughout the day. The goal of this is to be able to present something.
      </p>

      <p>Copy and paste ideas<br>Treat nothing as precious<br>Love your concept<br>Break things down incrementally<br>Start by modifying one small thing at a time<br>Break things down so you can Google pieces one by one and add them together</p>

      <h1>Publishing</h1>

      <p>How do you carve a space for yourself on the web? This is a completely inexhaustive list; feel free to share your own recommendations!</p>

      <h3>Option 1: Glitch</h3>
      <p>If you used Glitch from any of the templates, simply create an account so you can preserve your file. (Otherwise it gets deleted in 5 days.) Each project gets its own Glitch url that you can freely share! </p>
      <a href="https://glitch.com">Glitch</a>
      <hr>
      <h3>Option 2: Github</h3>
      <p>Another (slightly more difficult) standard is Github. Github is the industry standard for storing and tracking software projects in repositories. Github Pages is its service that allows you to turn your repositories into sites with ease. On Github, your projects are all served under your own subdomain (like this site!). </p>

      <p>For each project, you would create a new repository and upload your files. <strong>Github Pages</strong>needs to be enabled in the settings of each repository; make sure your <code>index.html</code> file is in the root of your repository. <br>For managing files, I personally use <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Desktop</a> to handle all the file transfers from my local computer — it makes things incredibly easy.</p>

      <p>You can connect your Github and Glitch accounts to quickly import/export projects as repositories. Alternatively, you can download your Glitch project as a .zip, unzip it on your local computer, and drag & drop it onto Github's site.</p>

      <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> &
      <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages Information</a>

      <hr>

      <h3>Option 3: Get your own web hosting or a server</h3>
      <p>A bit too much to explain briefly &mdash; but this would give you total control. Buy a domain and shared hosting + a server; you're set.</p>

      <p>Popular options include Porkbun, Namecheap, <a href="https://neocities.org">Neocities</a> (this is free), among others.</p>

      <hr>

      <h3>How about a domain?</h3>
      <p>You can buy a domain and connect it to Glitch or Github. You would <em>need</em> a domain for Option 3.</p>
